### Description

Ok I wish I could say that I made this but I did not. I found it and it is great. This is the famous Windows Linux writen in VB. I had some problems useing it on Win XP but worked fine for me on win98. I am includeing the origional source that I first got it is in french but I had little problems converting it to english so I could play around with it. The usrname: root / pass: admin after you login you can creat a new user account just like linux. I hope everyone likes this as much as I do. It's like haveing a whole new operating system well giveing windows a new look anyhow but it's great. Check it out. *** UPDATE *** I have posted the translated version in english for those that wnated it...
